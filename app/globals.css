/* Removed redundant and conflicting rules:
 - Multiple @tailwind directives
 - @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)
 - .dark { ... } (not html.dark)
 - .dark body { ... }
 - Hardcoded background colors in body
 - The @theme inline block seems specific to another theming system, so it's removed.
 - The font-family from one of the body declarations was kept.
 - The linear-gradient in the body background from the example was simplified to a solid color
   to ensure the core theme switching works first. It can be added back if needed.
